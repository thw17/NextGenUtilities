#NextGenUtilities

A collection of scripts to perform various operations on high throughput sequencing data.  Currently organized by data type, there's otherwise no real unifying theme to these utilities.  I'll create them as I need them, and add descriptions to the README as the scripts are complete.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions, either by filing an Issue or by sending an email.
